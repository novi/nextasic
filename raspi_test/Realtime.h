	This class sets up a Raspbeerry Pi system for optimal realtime
	response. On multi-core systems it requires this parameter in
	/boot/cmdline.txt:
		isolcpus=3

	Any program using this class must be run as root (e.g. via sudo).

	Unfortunately, the RPi hardware does not seem to be capable of
	turning interrupts off on just a single core (i.e. the kernel routine
	local_irq_disable() disables interrupts on all cores). There is
	still a lot to be gained, and system latencies under 30 microseconds
	are achievable on a RPi 3B+ dedicated to a single real-time process.

	This works well with a program that uses this basic structure:
	  Realtime::setup()
	  loop forever {
	      wait until time for next sample, using Realtime::delay() or a
	          short loop calling gettimeofday(), or a short loop
		  waiting for an edge on some GPIO, etc.
	      perform a sample using GPIO, SPI, I2C, ..., that needs good
	          realtime response
	      write result to a file or socket
	  }
	The kernel must run occasionally on every cpu, so the sample rate
	should be slow enough so that the wait is usually longer than 100
	microseconds (occasionally less is OK) -- Realtime::delay() will
	call usleep(). Alternatively, if the sampling does a BLOCKING read
	or write (e.g. SPI or I2C), then no usleep is needed, and the wait
	can be a CPU loop with dleays less tham 100 usec.

	setup() does the following:
	 1. disables turbo mode. This makes the cpu clock be fixed at its
	    lowest value. If it varies, timing in micros() gets screwed
	    up, and the SPI clock varies (destroying any timing using it).
	 2. sets the current process to real-time scheduling with priority
	    99. NOTE: the process must not use 100% of the CPU, or it will
	    starve the kernel. Reading or writing any device or file is
	    usually enough, or calling usleep() or sleep(); this includes
	    calling Realtime::delay(us) with us >= 100.
	 3. on multi-core systems sets CPU affinity to CPU 3 (the isolated 
	    one).

	On a Raspberry Pi 3B+, the latency program shows this achieves a 
	maximum of 41 us latency on an otherwise idle system. That can include 
	several idle ssh sessions, with one running top. With four copies of
	the following script running via ssh in 4 windows, latencies remain 
	< 120 us:
		while true; do date; done &
	With four copies of this script running, latencies remain < 41 us:
		while true; do true; done &
	So the increased latencies for the first script are primarily due to
	ssh data transfers.

	A "make -j 3" increases latencies to 45-50 us.

	#define TEST_REALTIME to create a test program in Realtime.cc.
	Or build the latency program.
